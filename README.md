# UNSUPERVISED_LEARNING
In unsupervised learning, a dataset is provided without labels, and a model learns useful properties of the structure of the dataset. It uses machine learning algorithm to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.  

Another name for unsupervised learning is knowledge discovery. Common unsupervised learning techniques include clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

1. CLUSTERING

It mainly is a task of dividing the set of observations into subsets, called clusters, based on similarities or differences.

  1.1. KMean Clustering
  1.2. Hierarchical Clustering
      Four different methods are commonly used to measure similarity.
        1.2.1. Ward's linkage
        1.2.2. Average linkage
        1.2.3. Complete linkage
        1.2.4. Single linkage

2. DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

  2.1. PCA 
  It is a type of dimensionality reduction algorithm which is used to identification of a smaller number of uncorrelated variables known as principal components from a larger set of data.
